From K-pop to K-drama, the Korean wave (Hallyu) has slowly seeped into European and North American culture. Movies and music, however, can often be misleading and some of the cultural nuances are lost for the sake of entertainment. Work ethics, treatment of homosexuals, and May-December relationships are just some of the dynamics that are quite different from the West. Movies such as \"Hello Schoolgirl\", while providing light entertainment, provide a small peek into the inner workings of South Korean society. </p>\n<p>In the following clip, Kim Yeon-woo meets up with his neighbor Soo-Young on the way home after work. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7fpdjZYreU\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3>Reflect</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW8141003 BCX0\">How are relationships with a large age gap viewed in your family or in your culture? </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW8141003 BCX0\">Do you think the age between two adults makes a big difference between friends and couples</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW8141003 BCX0\">?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Explore</h3>\n<p>Hae-rin, L.

A Westerner, even one who purports to understand Chinese, can never reach a full comprehension of the subtleties of Chinese writing. Zuang Zi's writing was a product of his time and Western interpretations and readings are heavily influenced by Western philosophy.
